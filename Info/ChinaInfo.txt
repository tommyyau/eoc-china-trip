The flight prices for next May have not yet been released. Airlines usually announce the official fares around February next year.
In addition, if the dates fall within the school holiday period, there may be no discounted fares, and we may have to purchase tickets at the standard prices set by the airlines.

The £600 mentioned at this stage is only our preliminary estimate for reference.

May 25–29 next year falls within the UK school half-term holiday.

The most ideal departure date would be 8 May, as the weather is better and airfares are more likely to have discounts at that time.

Good morning!

Regarding the departure time for your trip to China next May, the confirmed departure date is May 8.

On May 14–15 next year, we will be hosting a comprehensive event at the Westminster Conference Centre in London. However, we have prioritized the hiking tour experience.

Should you feel that departing on May 8 works best for your outdoor activity experience, we are fully proceeding with this plan. We can work together to further optimize the itinerary to ensure a smooth and enjoyable journey.

We look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
